# Talk: Continuous Deployment To Kubernetes

## Abstract

Kubernetes is becoming a de-facto standard for container orchestration. Jenkins is already the standard for continuous deployment. How can we combine both and get the most out of both worlds?

We'll discuss continuous deployment pipeline that delivers new releases on every commit. We'll explore how to ensure that the release is safe to deploy, how to leverage Jenkins and Kubernetes features to speed up the process, and how to guarantee that new versions are running in production without risk, with zero-downtime, and without human intervention.

# Talk: Continuous Deployment With Jenkins X, Docker, And Kubernetes

## Abstract

Jenkins X, an open source project introduced to the community by CloudBees, enables the rapid creation, delivery and orchestration of cloud-native applications based on continuous delivery best practices and the proven Kubernetes platform.

By combining the power of Jenkins, its community and the power of Docker and Kubernetes, the Jenkins X project provides a path to the future of continuous delivery for microservices and cloud-native applications.

Jenkins X is Jenkins and additional best of breed tools and software for Kubernetes. It provides an interactive command-line interface to instantiate applications, repositories, environments, and pipelines and  orchestrate continuous integration and continuous delivery

It is the CI/CD solution for development of modern cloud applications on Kubernetes

We'll explore some of the features of Jenkins X through a hands-on demo.

## Abstract

Kubernetes is becoming a de-facto standard for container orchestration. Jenkins is already the standard for continuous deployment. How can we combine both and get the most out of both worlds?

We'll try to design a continuous deployment pipeline that delivers new releases on every commit. We'll explore how to ensure that the release is safe to deploy, how to leverage Jenkins and Kubernetes features to speed up the process, and how to guarantee that new versions are running in production without risk, with zero-downtime, and without human intervention.
