# Solution Assembly and Ranking Prompt

You are a Kubernetes expert. Given this user intent, available resources, and
organizational patterns, create and rank complete solutions that address the
user's needs.

## PATTERN PRIORITIZATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Pattern-Aware Resource Selection:**
- **Pattern resources are included** in the Available Resources list below with source marked as "organizational-pattern"
- **Golden Path Priority** - Pattern resources represent approved organizational standards and should rank higher than alternatives
- **Higher-Level Abstractions** - Pattern resources often provide better user experience than low-level cloud provider resources

**SOLUTION ASSEMBLY APPROACH:**

1. **Analyze Available Resources**: Review capabilities, providers, complexity, and use cases
2. **Apply Pattern Logic**: Read pattern rationales to understand when they apply
3. **Create Complete Solutions**: Assemble resources into working combinations
4. **Rank by Effectiveness**: Score based on capability match, pattern compliance, and user intent

**CRITICAL: Pattern Conditional Logic**
- **Read each pattern's "Rationale" field carefully** - it specifies WHEN the pattern applies
- **Apply patterns conditionally** - only include pattern resources when their technical conditions are met
- **Resource compatibility analysis**: Before including pattern resources in a solution, verify the pattern's rationale matches the resources you're selecting
- **API group dependencies**: If a pattern rationale mentions specific API groups (e.g., "solutions using X.api"), only apply that pattern when the solution actually uses resources from those API groups
- **Multi-provider abstractions**: Higher-level abstractions that work across providers should not automatically trigger provider-specific auxiliary patterns unless technically required
- **Pattern compliance increases solution score** - solutions following organizational patterns should rank higher, but only when patterns are correctly applied based on technical compatibility

Create multiple alternative solutions. Consider:
- **🥇 FIRST: Pattern-based solutions** - Complete solutions using organizational patterns when applicable
- **🥈 SECOND: Technology-focused solutions** - Solutions optimized for specific technologies or providers  
- **🥉 THIRD: Complexity variations** - Simple vs comprehensive approaches
- Direct relevance to the user's needs (applications, infrastructure, operators, networking, storage)  
- Common Kubernetes patterns and best practices
- Resource relationships and combinations
- Production deployment patterns
- Complex multi-component solutions
- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** that might provide higher-level abstractions or simpler alternatives
- Platform-specific resources (e.g., Crossplane, Knative, Istio, ArgoCD) that could simplify the deployment
- **Infrastructure components**: networking (Ingress, Service, NetworkPolicy), storage (PVC, StorageClass), security (RBAC, ServiceAccount)
- **Database operators**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis operators that provide managed database services
- **Monitoring and observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager, logging operators
- **Operator patterns**: Look for operators that provide simplified management of complex infrastructure
- **CRD Selection Priority**: If you see multiple CRDs from the same group with similar purposes (like "App" and "AppClaim"), include the namespace-scoped ones (marked as "Namespaced: true") rather than cluster-scoped ones, as they're more appropriate for application deployments

**Generate 2-5 different solutions** that genuinely address the user intent. Prioritize relevance over quantity - it's better to provide 2-3 high-quality, relevant solutions than to include irrelevant alternatives just to reach a target number.

## Response Format

Respond with ONLY a JSON object containing an array of complete solutions.
Each solution should include resources, description, scoring, and pattern
compliance:

**CRITICAL**: For each resource in your solutions, you MUST include the
`resourceName` field. This field contains the correct plural, lowercase
resource name used for kubectl explain calls. Extract this from the Available
Resources list - each resource shows its `resourceName` field that you
should copy exactly.
