# Practical Kubernetes

## Abstract

Kubernetes is a container scheduler and quite a lot more. We can use it to deploy our services, to roll out new releases without downtime, and to scale (or de-scale) those services. It is portable. It can run on a public or private cloud. It can run on-premise or in a hybrid environment. Kubernetes, in a way, makes your infrastructure vendor agnostic. We can move a Kubernetes cluster from one hosting vendor to another without changing (almost) any of the deployment and management processes. Kubernetes can be easily extended to serve nearly any needs. We can choose which modules we'll use, and we can develop additional features ourselves and plug them in.

If we choose to use Kubernetes, we decide to relinquish control. Kubernetes will decide where to run something and how to accomplish the state we specify. Such control allows Kubernetes to place replicas of a service on the most appropriate server, to restart them when needed, to replicate them, and to scale them. We can say that self-healing is a feature included in its design from the start.

Zero-downtime deployments, fault tolerance, high availability, scaling, scheduling, and self-healing should be more than enough to see the value in Kubernetes. Yet, that is only a fraction of what it provides. We can use it to mount volumes for stateful applications. It allows us to store confidential information as secrets. We can use it to validate the health of our services. It can load balance requests and monitor resources. It provides service discovery and easy access to logs. And so on and so forth. The list of what Kubernetes does is long and rapidly increasing. Together with Docker, it is becoming a platform that envelops whole software development and deployment lifecycle.

The goal of this fast-paced session is to get acquanted with fundamentals building blocks of Kubernetes.
